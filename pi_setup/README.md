Official Raspberry Pi Setup Procedure for Matrioshka
====================================================

This is the official procedure to setup a Raspberry Pi from scratch.  We use Raspbian Jessie Lite as the operating system.


Installing Jessie Lite on SD Card
---------------------------------

Download the latest Raspbian Jessie Lite image from [www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

Follow the instructions ([Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md), [Mac](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md) or [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)) to transfer the image to an SD card of at least 4GB, ideally 8GB+.

The SD card is ready!
